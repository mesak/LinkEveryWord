# LinkEveryWord Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-31

Thank you for using the LinkEveryWord Chrome extension ("the Extension"). We respect your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

## 1. Information we collect
The Extension collects data only when you actively use it:
- Selected text: When you select text and trigger the hotkey, the Extension reads that text to send to your configured backend for search.
- Settings: Your configured options (hotkeys, backend URL, query key) stored via chrome.storage.sync.
- Technical: We do not collect browsing history, IP address, or other personally identifiable information.

## 2. How we use the information
- To provide the core features (send selected text to your backend and display results in the side panel).
- To save your options to improve the user experience.
- We do not use the data for ads, analytics, or any commercial purpose.

## 3. Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties, unless:
- You explicitly authorize it (e.g., using your own backend).
- Required by law.
- Your backend is self-configured and not controlled by us.

## 4. Security
- Selected text is processed in your browser and sent to the backend over HTTPS (if configured).
- Settings are stored in your Chrome account and protected by Google.
- We do not store any data on our servers.

## 5. Your rights
- Control options in the Extension settings.
- Disable or remove the Extension from Chrome.
- Clear Chrome sync data to remove saved settings.

## 6. Children’s privacy
The Extension is not intended for children under 13. If we discover children’s data, we will delete it.

## 7. Updates
We may update this policy from time to time. Major changes will be announced via the Extension update notes or the Chrome Web Store. Continued use means you accept the updates.
